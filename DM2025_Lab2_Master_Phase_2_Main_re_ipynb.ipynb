This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",

        "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
        "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
        "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
        "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
        "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
        "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
        "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",

            "4.  **Modeling:** This is where we select and apply our data mining algorithms (like classification, clustering, etc.) to the prepared data.\n",
            "5.  **Evaluation:** How well did our model perform? Does it actually solve the business problem we defined in step 1? We test its validity and accuracy.\n",
            "6.  **Deployment:** The final step is to put the model to work. This could be a new spam filter, a product recommendation engine on a website, or a report of customer segments for the marketing team.\n",

Traditional statistics is often about *explaining* a phenomenon and testing hypotheses on a small, clean sample of data. Data mining is often more focused on *prediction* and finding patterns in large, messy, real-world datasets.\n",

The rule is: `IF {diapers} THEN {beer}`.\n*   **Other Examples:** Discovering which medical conditions often co-occur, which products are frequently bought together on an e-commerce site (\"Customers who bought this also bought...\").\n\n#### 5. Anomaly or Outlier Detection\nThis task focuses on identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset.\n\n*   **Question it answers:** \"What is weird or unexpected?\"\n*   **Classic Example:** **Credit Card Fraud Detection.** Your bank knows your typical spending pattern. If a charge suddenly appears from a different country for a large amount, the system flags it as an anomaly—a potential fraud.\n*   **Other Examples:** Detecting faulty equipment on a manufacturing line, identifying network intrusions.\n\n### The Data Mining Process (CRISP-DM)\n\nAs I mentioned, data mining is a process. The most widely used framework for this process is the **CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)**. It has six phases:\n\n1.  **Business Understanding:** What is the problem we are trying to solve? What does a successful outcome look like? This is the most important step.\n2.  **Data Understanding:** What data do we have? Is it accessible? What are its limitations?\n3.  **Data Preparation:** This is often the most time-consuming phase (up to 80% of the work!). It involves cleaning the data (handling missing values, correcting errors), combining data sources, and transforming it into a suitable format for modeling. **Garbage in, garbage out.**\n4.  **Modeling:** This is where we select and apply our data mining algorithms (like classification, clustering, etc.) to the prepared data.\n5.  **Evaluation:** How well did our model perform? Does it actually solve the business problem we defined in step 1? We test its validity and accuracy.\n6.  **Deployment:** The final step is to put the model to work. This could be a new spam filter, a product recommendation engine on a website, or a report of customer segments for the marketing team.\n\n### Data Mining vs. Related Fields\n\nYou'll hear a lot of buzzwords. Let's clarify the landscape.\n\n*   **Data Mining vs. Machine Learning (ML):** Think of Machine Learning as the toolbox. It provides the algorithms (the \"drills,\" \"saws,\" and \"hammers\") that are used during the *Modeling* phase of the data mining process. Data Mining is the overall process, the entire construction project.\n*   **Data Mining vs. Statistics:** They are deeply related, but have different focuses. Traditional statistics is often about *explaining* a phenomenon and testing hypotheses on a small, clean sample of data. Data mining is often more focused on *prediction* and finding patterns in large, messy, real-world datasets.\n*   **Data Mining vs. Data Science:** Data Science is a broader umbrella term that encompasses data mining, machine learning, statistics, data visualization, software engineering, and domain expertise. Data mining is a core component *within* the field of data science.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, what is data mining? It's the disciplined, systematic process of sifting through vast amounts of data to find hidden gold—the patterns and insights that allow us to make better decisions, understand our world more deeply, and create smarter technology. It's the engine behind your Netflix recommendations, your bank's fraud alerts, and the medical breakthroughs of tomorrow.\n\nAny questions?"

            "Step 2: Transfer the rinsed rice to the saucepan. Add the water and optional salt. Give it one quick stir to combine.\n",
            "Step 3: Place the saucepan over high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil.\n",
            "Step 4: Once boiling, immediately reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting that maintains a gentle simmer. Cover the pot with the tight-fitting lid.\n",
            "Step 5: Let the rice cook, covered, for 15 minutes. Do not lift the lid or stir during this time, as this lets the essential steam escape.\n",
            "Step 6: After 15 minutes, remove the pot from the heat entirely. Let it stand, still covered, for an additional 5-10 minutes. This step allows the moisture to redistribute for a perfectly even texture.\n",
            "Step 7: Remove the lid and gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. Serve immediately.\n",
            "\n",
            "Time Required: 25-30 minutes\n",
            "\n",
            "Tips:\n",
            " - The water-to-rice ratio is crucial. For most long-grain white rice, a 1.5:1 water-to-rice ratio by volume is ideal. For a softer texture, you can use up to 2 cups of water.\n",
            " - Do not skip rinsing the rice. It is the most important step for achieving fluffy, individual grains rather than a sticky clump.\n",
            " - A heavy-bottomed saucepan helps distribute heat more evenly and prevents the rice at the bottom from scorching.\n",
            " - Resist the temptation to peek! Keeping the lid on traps the steam needed to cook the rice properly.\n"

              " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

        "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
        "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
        "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
        "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
